Simple python module implementation of shannon entropy
<p>This is a very bare bones implementation of a single algorithm. I am a beginner at python, and not a great programmer.
If your looking for a more robust and complete solution I found this <a href = "https://github.com/nikdon/pyEntropy">pyEntropy</a>
and this <a href = "https://github.com/dit/dit">dit - Python package for information theory</a>
